In order to make my website more responsive I used percentage values for my body text size and image width so that 
they would scale no matter the size of my browser (also used ‘max-width’ to allow width and heigh to change 
depending on the size of my browser). For the heading I used the ‘vw’ unit so that it would scale with the viewport 
the user was on and stop the text from leaving the page. I used the 
‘ <meta name="viewport"content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">’ so that the width browswer would always fit 
the width of the device.
