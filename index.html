                I was provided with an API specification for a RESTful API. In the first part of the assignment, 
                I developed the back-end application that implemented the API specification. In the second part 
                of the assignment, I developed the front-end application that interacts with an API to 
                provide functionality to its users. I was required to write both applications using the 
                frameworks and technologies taught to me throughout the Unit in the lectures and the labs.

            <p> 
                I was required to design and implement in Processing (a Java IDE), my own original 2-D 
                Siege game, where the player character can move horizontally across the top of the screen 
                (arrow cluster key controls), dropping objects on to attackers. Attackers will be moving up 
                the screen slowly (and perhaps left and right movement as well). I also implemented an 
                ArrayList of attacker objects and an animated sequence of images for the attacker objects 
                (that made them appear to be climbing).

                For this assignment I had to carry out an analysis of Travel and Tourism Ltd existing 
                system (the details of the sytem where provided in the case study's documentation) and from 
                this analysis produced a set of recommendations for its improvement and implementation. 
                I presented the analysis and recommendations in the form of a report. The report contained 
                an explaination the background, the purpose of the report, problem statement a Top-Down 
                Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the proposed system using UML diagramming conventions,  
                Relational Data Analysis (RDA) and an explanation of any differences with the ERD previously 
                generated. I implemented the database using data insertions and MariaDB.

                My task was to create a piece of code that mimiced a Kiosk selling Burgers of various types 
                of bread (plainRoll, granaryRoll, whiteBreadSandwich) with various fillings available 
                (fish, meat, spicyMeat, veggie, vegan). My solution had to allow for future exapnsion of the 
                kiosk such as the introduction of new family of fillings (say cheese) across the bread range

                I was provided with a Logisim file that simulates a simple programmable computer and a MIPS 
                assembly language program for use within the MARS simulation environment, on which I carried 
                out a set of tasks as described in my specification.I then had to explain how the Logisim CPU
                runs a program, compare programming the Logisim CPU to MIPS Assembly and draw links between 
                programming in a high-level language and in CPU simulation

                During my first year I was required to develop a web application that showcased my ability to 
                create basic web pages using HTML to mark-up content, control its presentation using CSS
                and write efficient and readable client-side scripts that are event and object-driven. It 
                also had to run on multiple browsers and apply web design usability principles in its design.

            <p> 
                The DefenderZ Game was the most complex of a series of simple programming tasks that I did 
                during the first year. It required 2 classes, a colour based collision with a for loop, 
                a gameMode variable to stop the game if a crash occured and 3 aliens that spawned from the 
                right of the screen and could move across to the other end.
